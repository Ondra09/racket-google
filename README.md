# Google APIs for Racket

## client_secret.json is missing client_secret field
When crating  Desktop application, downloaded .json is missing client_secret field. This value could be obtained right after creation of OAuth 2.0 credentials.
[https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials] client_secret is briefly shown to you. You can createn new field in client_secret.json and copy paste it there.
After I created the secret I was not able to see it again ever.
